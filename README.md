# project-burndown
A project management chart designed for AGILE teams using the story points tracking system. It is designed to be used as a burndown. Upload data from CSV files (example included) to submit data to the chart.
Created while on work experience at IBM Hursley.

Super basic system which wasn't really intended for use by anyone. Public repository just because...
